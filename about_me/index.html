    <h2>Brian Kummer</h2>
    <p>Hello, 
        My name is Brian Kummer and I live in Grantsville, Utah. My wife and I have been married for 29 years. We have three children who are all married, and we have one grandson We are hoping for many more grandchildren in the coming years. My hobbies are riding horses and flyfishing. I have worked for UPS for 30 years and will be retiring soon. 
        I love BYU-Idaho because of the way that secular learning is mixed with spiritual learning. I feel they build off of each other and increase my ability to grow. The degree that I am working for is Applied Technology. I am on the path to earn a BS degree. I enjoy learning about computers and technology. Web development is intriguing to me because of how much of the world relies on websites.  
        I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 44 years. I love the gospel and I love my Savior Jesus Christ. My favorite scripture is Ether 12:27 – “And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.” If we rely on the Lord in all that we do and have faith and work hard we can accomplish anything.

Let's create a CSS file. Create a folder at the same level as our HTML file and call it styles. Within that folder, let's create a styles.css file. Open that styles.css in the editor. (Again, if you already have this CSS file you can just add to it.)

Let's change the font size and line-height of the paragraph in the main section of our page, but we don't want it to effect the footer paragraph. So we can give our paragraph a class or ID attribute to differentiate it from all other paragraphs on the page.

<p class='main-para'>BYU-Idaho is a comfortable place to learn and grow as a disciple of Jesus Christ because students, faculty, and employees share a commitment to live the gospel.</p>
Then in CSS we can target just that class by using a dot selector. Classes are specified with a dot or period before the class name in CSS.
